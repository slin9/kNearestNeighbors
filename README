kNN.py - Harrington's original kNN classification method with test
kNN_regress.py - extension of kNN.py that performs regression using
either a simple average or a distance-weighted average.  The
toy example demonstrates a simple property of kNN in that regression 
estimates can never exceed the maximum of the targets in training; 
consequently, we cannot rely on the method to generate any extrapolated
values from the data as would be possible using e.g. linear regression.
